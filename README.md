#From Solitary to the Street

Every year, prisons across the country send thousands of people directly from solitary confinement back into their communities. An investigation by [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/06/11/from-solitary-to-the-street?ref=hp-1-111) and [NPR](http://www.npr.org/2015/06/11/413208055/from-solitary-to-the-streets-released-inmates-get-little-help) found that 24 states released more than 10,000 people from solitary last year.

The actual total is higher, as 26 states and the federal Bureau of Prisons could not say how often it happens. These individuals go from complete isolation one day to complete freedom the next, yet they are in many ways the least equipped to make the transition home. Inside prison, those in solitary — many of whom suffer from mental illnesses that were either triggered or exacerbated in segregation — often cannot participate in the classes or services offered to other inmates approaching their release date. And in several states once those inmates in solitary are freed, they are more likely to be released without the help of a probation or parole officer. Those who make the jarring leap from solitary to the streets can easily end up jobless, homeless — or back in prison.

Our story, "[From Solitary to the Street](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/06/11/from-solitary-to-the-street?ref=hp-1-111)," published by [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/) with [NPR](http://www.npr.org/2015/06/11/413208055/from-solitary-to-the-streets-released-inmates-get-little-help) on June 11, 2015, examined the practice in prisons across the nation.

Included in this repo is [the data](data/) collected by reporter Christie Thompson from all the states who could provide it. The uncleaned and unaggregated data is [published on DocumentCloud](https://www.documentcloud.org/public/search/projectid:20529-solitary-to-the-streets) and provided here in its original form, whether it be email, pdf, Microsoft Word document or Excel spreadsheet.

##Reporters: How You Can Use Our Data

In September, The Marshall Project and NPR set out to tally how often U.S. prisons released someone straight from solitary confinement. The answer we found over a 9-month investigation: it’s complicated. Over half of the states and the federal Bureau of Prisons could not provide any data (or in some states, not without hundreds or thousands of dollars in fees). In the 24 states we did get data from, the numbers vary significantly. Some of the big differences:

* Some states could only tell us how many were coming straight from administrative segregation — units meant to house prisoners suspected of being gang members or threats to the prison security. Others included disciplinary segregation or protective custody (in which prisoners are segregated for their own safety).
* Some states count by calendar year, some by fiscal.
* The overall number of releases for state prison system vary widely.
* Some states included deaths, escapes or transfers to other custody, like ICE, in their spreadsheets. We did not include those numbers in our tally, but the categories are still in the original documents.

That’s why you can’t take these numbers and try to do an apples-to-apples comparison of how states rank.

What you can do with the data is further investigate how your state prison system deals with segregated prisoners approaching the end of their sentence, and give this national investigation a local focus.

You now have the numbers of how many releases straight from solitary have happened in your state as far back as 2008. Some have even broken it down by how many were released on parole or probation, versus maxing out their sentence and coming home with no supervision.

Wyoming and Kansas provided a list of inmate ID numbers, which can be used to track down individual stories. In other states, you can copy our tactic: reach out to local reentry nonprofits and prisoner family organizations to try and find families that have experienced this. Several states (including New Mexico, Wisconsin, Louisiana and South Carolina, to name a few) noted that they were also starting some new programming to help ease segregated prisoners into life outside.
