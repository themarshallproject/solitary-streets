#From Solitary to the Street

Every year, prisons across the country send thousands of people directly from solitary confinement back into their communities. An investigation by [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/06/11/from-solitary-to-the-street?ref=hp-1-111) and [NPR](http://www.npr.org/2015/06/11/413208055/from-solitary-to-the-streets-released-inmates-get-little-help) found that 24 states released more than 10,000 people from solitary last year. 

The actual total is higher, as 26 states and the federal Bureau of Prisons could not say how often it happens. These individuals go from complete isolation one day to complete freedom the next, yet they are in many ways the least equipped to make the transition home. Inside prison, those in solitary — many of whom suffer from mental illnesses that were either triggered or exacerbated in segregation — often cannot participate in the classes or services offered to other inmates approaching their release date. And in several states once those inmates in solitary are freed, they are more likely to be released without the help of a probation or parole officer. Those who make the jarring leap from solitary to the streets can easily end up jobless, homeless — or back in prison.

Our story, "[From Solitary to the Street](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/06/11/from-solitary-to-the-street?ref=hp-1-111)," published by [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/) with [NPR](http://www.npr.org/2015/06/11/413208055/from-solitary-to-the-streets-released-inmates-get-little-help) on June 11, 2015, examined the practice in prisons across the nation.

Included in this repo is [the data](data/) collected by reporter Christie Thompson from all the states who could provide it. The uncleaned and unaggregated data is [published on DocumentCloud](https://www.documentcloud.org/public/search/projectid:20529-solitary-to-the-streets) and provided here in its original form, whether it be email, pdf, Microsoft Word document or Excel spreadsheet.


##Data sources and caveats

In reporting this story, the Marshall Project contacted corrections departments in all 50 states and the federal Bureau of Prisons to ask what data they collect on the prisoners being released directly from any kind of segregated housing unit into the community. We asked for annual release counts from 2008 through 2014.

Twenty-four states provided some kind of data. The quality and coverage of the data we received varied widely. Some states were able to give numbers for releases from administrative segregation (for prisoners considered to be security threats), disciplinary segregation (for people that violate prison rules), and protective custody (to protect a prisoner from others). Other states could only provide numbers on releases from administrative segregation. Some states count these releases by calendar year and others by their own fiscal year. And several states could provide numbers for only a few of the years requested.

Despite compiling data tracking releases from solitary in these 24 states, the inconsistencies of how each state defines solitary and the different time spans provided prevented ranking or comparing them to any significant degree.
